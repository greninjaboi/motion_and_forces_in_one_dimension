    <p><em>What are Velocity and Acceleration?</em><br>
        In <a target="_blank"
            href="https://sciencing.com/what-is-the-difference-between-velocity-and-acceleration-13710473.html">"What
            is the Difference Between Velocity And Acceleration,"</a> Lee Johnson states, “Velocity is the rate of change of
        position with respect to time, whereas acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Both are vector
        quantities (and so also have a specified direction), but the units of velocity are meters per second while
        the units of acceleration are meters per second squared.” Both velocity and acceleration have magnitude. The
        velocity formula is “velocity = distance traveled/time taken.” The acceleration formula is “acceleration =
        change in velocity/time taken for velocity to change.” In <a target="_blank"
            href="https://sciencing.com/what-is-the-difference-between-velocity-and-acceleration-13710473.html"> "What
            is the Difference Between Velocity And Acceleration,"</a> Lee Johnson states, “Acceleration has units of
        distance/time squared - for example, meters/second^2.”
    </p>
    <p><em>Constant Velocity and Constant Acceleration Comparison From Source:</em><br>
        In <a target="_blank"
            href="https://sciencing.com/what-is-the-difference-between-velocity-and-acceleration-13710473.html">"What
            is the Difference Between Velocity And Acceleration,"</a> Lee Johnson states,“Traveling with a constant velocity
        means you're going at the same speed in the same direction continuously. If you have a constant velocity,
        this means you have zero acceleration. You can imagine this as driving down a straight road but keeping your
        speedometer on the same value. <br>
        A constant acceleration is quite different. If you travel with a constant acceleration, your velocity is
        always changing, but it's changing by a consistent amount each second. The acceleration due to gravity on
        the Earth has the constant value 9.8 m/s2, so you can imagine this like dropping something from a
        skyscraper. The velocity starts low, but increases by 9.8 m/s for every second it is falling under gravity.”
    </p>
    <p><em>How do I know if I switched velocity and acceleration?</em><br>
        Check your formulas. Velocity uses the distance traveled and the time taken, while acceleration uses the
        change in velocity and the time taken for velocity to change. Also remember that acceleration uses distance
        over time <strong>squared</strong>, while velocity does not.</p>
    <p><em>Why are the differences important?</em><br>
        It is important to know the differences between Velocity and Acceleration because knowing differences allows
        you to correctly assess the math in physics situations, whereas not knowing the differences could cause math
        errors that could cause problems in your career. An example would be if an astronaut switched velocity and
        acceleration in their math, and it caused a spaceship to overheat and kill people.</p>
    <p><em>How can I apply velocity and acceleration to my life?</em><br>
        I can apply this to my life by using the formulas and information I learned here in a future scientific
        career that requires physics. An example could be creating a 3D model that requires the ability to move at a
        certain speed using wheels and axles. Using this knowledge, I could know the correct size, shape, and axles
        to use for the model's movement.</p>

    <p><em><strong>Scalars</strong> are quantities that are described by a magnitude (or numerical value) and no
        direction.</em></p>
    <p><em><strong>Vectors</strong> are quantities that are described by both a magnitude and a direction.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Both velocity and acceleration are vector quantities.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Why do we need to understand scalars and vectors?</em><br>
        We need to understand vectors and scalars because they not only help us understand the world around us
        better, but they also allow us to solve important problems in physics such as how much of something there is
        or what direction something is going in.
    </p>
    <p><em>How do I remember the differences between scalars and vectors?</em><br>
        Simply associate vectors with direction, and you will have no problems remembering overall differences.You
        can also remember by stating something such as, “Vectors are directors,” recite the differences aloud or in
        your head, or write down the traits of scalars and vectors on paper.
    </p>
    <p><em>How can I apply scalars and vectors to my life?</em><br>
        I can use my knowledge of scalars and vectors to make projects in a future career, hobby, or even everyday
        life. Scalars can allow me to measure things in programming, building, cooking, modeling, and more. Vectors
        allow me to measure things in driving, hiking, navigating, physics jobs, and more.

    <p><strong>Newton's First Law is, “An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion
            at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.”</strong></p>
    <p>In the article <a target="_blank"

            of Motion,”</a> NASA Official Nancy Hall states, “Newton's first law states that every object will remain
        at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an
        external force. This tendency to resist changes in a state of motion is inertia. There is no net force
        acting on an object (if all the external forces cancel each other out). Then the object will maintain a
        constant velocity. If that velocity is zero, then the object remains at rest. If an external force acts on
        an object, the velocity will change because of the force.”</p>

        I can apply Newton's First Law to my life by using it in my 3D modeling when creating physics based objects

    <p><strong>Newton's Second Law is, "The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the
            amount of force applied.”</strong></p>
    <p>The second law states that a force is equal to change in momentum (momentum is mass multiplied by velocity.)
        per the change in time. The definition of momentum is the mass m of an object multiplied by its velocity V.

            is the Difference Between Velocity And Acceleration"</a> Lee Johnson states, “Acceleration, rather than velocity,
        forms a key part of Newton's second law of motion. The equation is F = ma, where F stands for force,
        m is mass, and a is the acceleration. Because of the link between velocity and acceleration, you can
        also write this as force = mass * the rate of change of velocity. However, acceleration is the key
        characteristic here, not velocity.”</p>
    <p><em>Examples of Newton's Second Law are:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The motion of a bottle rocket while shooting into the air. This is the result of aerodynamic forces, the weight of the bottle and

    <p><em>Facts About Motion Graphs:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Distance is also known as displacement.</li>
        <li>With velocity and no acceleration, the position of a moving object increases at a constant rate to the graph
            - it is linear and has a slope. For example, if the velocity is 5 m/s, the displacement will increase by 5
            meters per second</li>
        <li>With velocity and no acceleration, the velocity of a moving object remains the same.</li>
        <li>Velocity is the rate of change of displacement, also known as displacement divided by time.</li>
        <li>The formula for velocity is “slope = rise/run = displacement/time = velocity.” You can find velocity by
            using this formula and the information on a position graph.</li>
        <li>The formula for displacement is “area(under the graph) = rise x run = velocity x time = displacement.” You
            can find displacement by using this formula and the information from a velocity graph.</li>
        <li>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.</li>
        <li>With velocity and acceleration, the velocity increases at a constant rate (linear and with a slope) over
            time by the rate of the acceleration. For example, if the acceleration is 2 m/s^2, the velocity will
            increase by 2 meters per second.</li>
        <li>With velocity and acceleration, the position will increase exponentially. This is because as the velocity
            increases, the displacement increases at a growing rate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>How to Make a Motion Graph:</em><br>
        If you have stated velocity but no stated acceleration, use that as the increase of the position graph. For
        example, if the velocity is 3 m/s, increase the displacement of the position graph line by 3 meters per second
        until the object you are graphing reaches the end of a path or comes to a stop, putting points along the way to
        show the increase. After one second has passed in this example, the acceleration will be 0 m/s^2, the velocity
        will be 3 m/s and the position will be 3 m.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have a stated acceleration, use that as the increase of the velocity graph. For example, if the
        acceleration is 1 m/s^2, increase the velocity by 1 meter per second. Then, use the formula “area(under the
        graph) = rise x run = velocity x time = displacement” to find displacement. When finding displacement in this
        way, you will have to do the formula multiple times at different key points (often whole numbers) on the
        velocity graph for an accurate curve. For example, if the acceleration is 1, the velocity is 0, and the position
        is 0, then when one second has passed, the acceleration will be 1 m/s^2, the velocity will be 1 m/s, and the
        position will be ½ m.
    </p>
    <p><em>How can I apply graphing motion to my life?</em><br>
        I can apply graphing motion to my life in many ways! I can make graphs for the motion of 3D models I make,
        determine how fast I complete hikes by using graphs, and even use graphs for estimating how long my airplane
        flights will be!</p>

    <img src=https://c8.alamy.com/comp/2DCKCR8/types-of-force-for-children-physics-educational-poster-illustration-2DCKCR8.jpg
        alt="Picture describing 8 types of forces" width="400">
    <p><strong>There are two types of forces. Contact Forces, which result from contact, and Action-at-a-Distance
            Forces, which result from non-contact.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Contact Forces:</strong><br>
        <em>Applied Force:</em><br>
        This force is applied to an object by another object or a person. An example is the push of a button.<br>
        <em>Normal Force:</em><br>
        This force is the support force by which force is exerted on an object that has contact with another object that
        is stable. An example is a pencil sitting on a desk.<br>
        <em>Frictional Force:</em><br>
        This force is the force that is exerted by a surface when an object moves or makes an effort to move across it.
        An example is the drag of a car on the road.<br>
        <em>Air Resistance Force:</em><br>
        This force is the force that acts upon objects as they travel through air. It often pushes against the motion of
        an object. An example is the drag of an airplane in the sky.<br>
        <em>Tension Force:</em><br>
        This force is the force that transmits through a rope, cable, wire, string, cord, or other thin object when
        pulled tightly by forces on both ends. This force causes an equal pull on objects on opposite sides of the
        string. An example is the cord that holds you in bungee jumping.<br>
        <em>Spring Force:</em><br>
        The force exerted by a spring upon an object that it is attached to. An example is the bounce of a trampoline.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Action-at-a-Distance Forces:</strong> <br>
        <em>Gravitational Force:</em><br>
        <em>This is the force by which a large object attracts another object. An example is the Earth attracting an
            asteroid. This is also, by definition, the weight of an object.</em><br>
        <em>Electrical Force:</em><br>
        <em>The force that electricity creates. An example is getting shocked by a power outlet.</em><br>
        <em>Magnetic Force:</em><br>
        <em>The force that magnets create. An example is when you attach opposite sides of two different magnets
            together and they stick in place.</em><br>
    </p>
    <p><em>How can I apply these types of forces to my life, and why are they important?</em><br>
        I can use types of forces literally anywhere I go. From writing with my pencil, to driving in a car, to talking,
        forces depict everything I will ever do. Understanding things around me is vital for my daily things, and
        therefore types of forces are important to understand!
